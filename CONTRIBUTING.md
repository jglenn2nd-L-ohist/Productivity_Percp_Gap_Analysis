# Contributing

Thanks for reading my portfolio project. If you'd like to propose improvements:

- Open an issue first describing the change.
- For code changes, open a new PR against the setup/jr-portfolio branch and include reproducible steps.
- Keep changes small and explain the reason/benefit in the PR description.
- Follow tidyverse style for R code and include package additions in the README.
